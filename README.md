The Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB&reg; has dependency on the repository toolbox-common-matlab.  

## Installation from github

To install the Toolbox on your computer from github follow these simple instructions.

From the shell:

```shell
% mkdir rvctools
% cd rvctools
% git clone https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-matlab.git robot
% git clone https://github.com/petercorke/toolbox-common-matlab.git common
% mv common/startup_rvc.m .
```

From within MATLAB
```
>> cd rvctools  % this is the same folder as above
>> startup_rvc
```
The second line sets up the MATLAB path appropriately but it's only for the current session.  You can either:
1. Repeat this everytime you start MATLAB
2. Add it to your `startup.m` file
3. Once you have run startup_rvc, run `pathtool` and push the `Save` button
